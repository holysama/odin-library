# Library

#28th of Februray 2025

Built a simple library using Object and Object constructors. I think it turned out well I took style inspiration from other repos and tried to implement different things that I thought were pretty cool, like transition and a bouncing button with a bin icon on it.

Still have to workout how to use CSS Variables but I think for the time being starting to use them is the best way to learn.
